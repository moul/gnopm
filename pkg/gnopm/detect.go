// Detection, so that flags stay optional.
//
// The rule this file exists to enforce: if gnopm can work something out, it
// works it out. A flag is an admission that the tool could not, and every
// required flag is friction paid on every invocation forever. `-upstream` was
// added to `verify` before this existed, and CI had to pass it explicitly,
// which is exactly the shape of thing that should never have shipped.

// upstreamRef returns the ref that pinned commits must be reachable from, and
// whether one could be determined at all.
//
// In order of confidence:
//
//  1. an explicit value, because the caller always wins;
//  2. the pull request's base branch, when running in one. GitHub Actions sets
//     GITHUB_BASE_REF only on pull_request events, which is exactly when the
//     check applies;
//  3. whatever origin/HEAD points at, the repository's real default branch,
//     which is not always main;
//  4. origin/main, then origin/master.
//
// Returns "" when none of those resolve, and callers then skip the check
// rather than guessing: a repository with no remote is a legitimate place to
// work, and refusing to operate there would be worse than not checking.
