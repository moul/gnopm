// Not simply HEAD, and this is the subtle part. This repository squash-merges:
// a pull request's commits do not survive onto the default branch, and once
// the branch is deleted those objects are unreachable from any branch or tag,
// so a fresh clone does not have them. A lock pinned to HEAD of a feature
// branch therefore stops resolving the moment the pull request lands, and
// `gnopm verify` fails on the default branch from then on, with nothing left
// to recover the version from.
//
// So the pin goes to a commit that is already on the default branch and holds
// byte-identical content. In the ordinary case that is just the branch tip:
// nothing has touched the package yet on this branch, so the version being
// left behind is exactly what the default branch has. Falling back to the last
// commit that touched the directory covers the case where the tip has moved on
// for unrelated reasons.
//
// If neither matches, the version being pinned genuinely exists nowhere but
// this branch. HEAD is then the only honest answer, and the caller is warned
// that the pin needs the merge to preserve it.
